## Persuasive Meme Detection
This project focuses on the detection and classification of persuasive memes. The research is divided into three main tasks:

# Tasks Overview

# Task 1: Persuasive vs Non-Persuasive Meme Classification
In this task, the goal is to classify whether a given meme is persuasive or non-persuasive. This binary classification helps to filter out non-persuasive memes from further analysis.

# Task 2: Intensity of Persuasion Detection
If a meme is classified as persuasive in Task 1, the next step is to determine the intensity of persuasion. The intensity is categorized on a scale from 0 to 5:

0: None
1: Negatively persuasive
2: Slightly Negatively persuasive
3: Neutral
4: Positively persuasive
5: Slightly Positively persuasive

# Task 3: Type of Persuasion Detection
For memes identified as persuasive, this task involves detecting the type of persuasive technique used. The possible categories include:

Personification
Irony
Alliteration
Analogies
Invective
Metaphor
Puns and Wordplays
Satire
Hyperboles
